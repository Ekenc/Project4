# Predicting Change in Glaciers And Sea Levels

## Project Description

Train supervised machine learning models to read historical data of glacier size, sea levels, global temperature, and greenhouse gases, including CO~2~ levels, to predict the possible future of glaciers and sea levels.

**Research Question:**
...What changes can be predicted for the near future based on historical data?

## Project Overview

### 1. Data

### 2. ML Model

### 3. Visualizations
We used Tableau Public to generate a dashbaord to organize our data outcomes in a more visually pleasing way for our audience. While the Tableau Public workobooks are in this repository to view them more easily, links to the publihsed dashboards will be provided by the corresponding visualization.

The Dahsboard:

World Glaciers & Ice Caps Map:

Due to the large size of the file it made more sense to run the map on a seperate Tableau workbook then import it onto the main dashboard as a pdf file. Another complication of the file size was being unable to push a file of it's size to GitHub. The data for the shapefiles was pulled from the National Snow and Ice Data Center and directly sourced in our credits below.
